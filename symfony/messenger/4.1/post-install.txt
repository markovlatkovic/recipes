  * You're ready to use the Messenger component. You can define your own message buses
    or start using the default one right now by injecting the <info>messenger.bus.default</info> service
    or typehinting <info>Symfony\Component\Messenger\MessageBusInterface</info> in your code.

  * If you need to send messages to your broker, you can benefit from the built-in
    AMQP transport by:

    1. Installing the AMQP pack by running <info>composer require amqp</>;
    2. Uncommenting the <comment>MESSENGER_ADAPTER_DSN</> env var
       and <comment>framework.messanger.transports.amqp</> config;
    3. Routing your messages to the amqp sender.
